# About-Me
I'm not new to programming but it has been a while. In high school I learned C++ but that was a while back. I have a degree in psychology and a little over half a doctorate in medicine. No I don't plan to go back to med school. I'm in the process of learning C#, JavaScript, and SQL. I'll add more to that list but for now three languages at once is enough. 

I regularly listen to the Code Newbie and .NET Rocks podcasts as well as the Jay and Silent Bob Got Old podcast. 

Several of my friends are .NET programmers and are mentoring me in this learning process. I recently wrote my first WinForms program, a calculator that I plan to update to a scientific calculator. I had enough fun with the trig functions.
