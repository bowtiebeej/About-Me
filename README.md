# About-Me
I am a full stack .NET developer. I primarily work with .NET Core and .NET 5 building WebAPIs on the back end and Angular on the front end. I have some experience with SQL but am not at DBA levels with it. I'm also in graduate school getting a master's degree in Data Science.

I co-host Complete Developer Podcast with my best friend/mentor. We cover all sorts of topics relating to development from the hard core technical to soft skills. We also lead a group here in Nashville called Developer Launchpad that is geared toward helping developers get started or advance in their careers.
